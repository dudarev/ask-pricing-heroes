{"Episode 4.md-0": "Hello and welcome to the #Pricing_Heroes podcast by Competera. It is a series of interviews with the best-in-class retail pricing experts driving their companies' bottom metrics and, therefore, the retail industry. \n\nOur today's guest is Stephan M. Liozu.", "Episode 4.md-1": "Our today's guest is Stephan M. Liozu.\n\nStephan M. Liozu is the Founder of Value Innoruption Advisors, a consulting boutique specializing in industrial, digital, and value-based pricing. He is the author of 12 books on pricing. He has also written many articles on strategic pricing issues for the Journal of Professional Pricing. Stephan sits on the Advisory Board of the Professional Pricing Society and LeveragePoint Innovation.", "Episode 4.md-2": "Q: Could you tell our listeners more about yourself and your background in pricing?", "Episode 4.md-3": "A: Sure. Interestingly, I didn't start my career in pricing. I rose to become CEO of a building materials company, but I always paid attention to value-based pricing because I worked for differentiated companies. So I decided to do a doctorate in value-based pricing and published a book on it. Since then, I have left the corporate world and have been helping companies get better at pricing. Young professionals should do a stint in pricing because it will make them better at sales, marketing, and supply chain. To have a career in pricing, you need both technical and soft skills.", "Episode 4.md-4": "Q: Could you give any advice to people deciding on their careers or moving deeper into pricing?\n\nA: I recommend people who want to become pricing managers to develop their business acumen and leadership skills. If you want to be a VP of pricing, you have to be a leader with a strong base on the technical side of the matter.\n\nQ: What are your killer tips for a killer change management strategy?", "Episode 4.md-5": "Q: What are your killer tips for a killer change management strategy?\n\nA: You have to be a change agent in pricing, so I recommend getting certified in change management. Use change management inherently in your work, and organizations will benefit from it. Organizations must adapt to changing markets, and you'll be at a disadvantage if you can't lead change.", "Episode 4.md-6": "When it comes to change management, it's essential for pricing professionals to understand the difference between change leadership and change management. Not only do you need to understand the technical side of change management, such as road mapping and stakeholder mapping, but you need to be an engine of change and a charismatic leader who knows how to bring people on board and convince with your authority.", "Episode 4.md-7": "Q: That sounds important. Could you share your thoughts on the retail industry in the last five years, particularly in 2020 and 2022?", "Episode 4.md-8": "A: Certainly. The last few years have been challenging for the retail industry, and 2020 was particularly crazy. In 2022, things weren't necessarily easier, but a few keywords came to mind. First, dynamic pricing is crucial. Retailers must be very agile and reactive in their pricing to avoid pricing themselves out of the market or leaving money on the table. They also need faster access to competitive data to understand what their competition is doing.", "Episode 4.md-9": "Second, supply chain resilience is essential. Retailers need to be able to secure their supply chains, as we've already seen empty shelves in drug stores due to the flu, colds, and COVID. Last year, thousands of products were not supplied or procured, impacting a retailer's bottom line and ability to grow, bundle products, and offer a full assortment.", "Episode 4.md-10": "Overall, retailers need to be super agile and think about faster and more collaborative teams that can respond quickly to changing situations. Everyone has suffered in the last two years, but retailers need to be more dynamically prepared for the next three to five years. It's also essential to stay relevant and differentiate yourself from companies like Amazon or Walmart, which are growing and attacking core businesses. Retailers must have the right product offerings and differentiation to compete against these larger companies.", "Episode 4.md-11": "Q: That makes sense. You mentioned the empty shelves in drugstores. How do you see retailers adapting to these kinds of challenges?", "Episode 4.md-12": "A: This is a typical example of a situation that retailers need to be prepared for. If you're a retailer, you need to be able to adapt quickly to changing conditions like this. Having the right product offerings and being online is crucial. Retailers need to differentiate themselves and compete with companies that are becoming larger and offer everything online. It's a new world, and retailers need to be ready to adapt.\nIt is important for businesses to quickly change their business models and adapt to the changing market. Retailers must change their portfolio or product assortment and react to market trends. They should be able to change their assortment and secure the supply chain quickly. The key is to anticipate what's going to happen in the future and have a strategy in place.", "Episode 4.md-13": "Q: How can retailers adapt to changes in pricing?", "Episode 4.md-14": "A: Retailers need to understand what's going up and what's going down in the supply chain and adapt very quickly. There's consistent inflation in the market, and consumers are upset about it. Retailers need to have a real-time pricing strategy that reflects what's happening in the supply chain. They need to stay relevant in pricing and ensure their pricing is fair to avoid customer backlash. To stay relevant, they need to know what their competition is doing and have pricing systems that dynamically track who does what. Consumers are shopping more often due to inflation and spend more time looking for alternatives.", "Episode 4.md-15": "OS\u200b\u200b: What are your thoughts on relevant pricing strategies for the next year?", "Episode 4.md-16": "A: Regarding pricing strategy for the next year, there are several factors retailers should consider. Profits are relatively high, so retailers should search for ways to raise their prices. However, they need to be careful not to overprice their products and lose customers to competitors. Competitive data should be analyzed to become better than competitors tech-wise. Finally, retailers need to understand their competitors' pricing strategies and determine where they can differentiate themselves.", "Episode 4.md-17": "Procurement managers in retail should challenge price increases from suppliers. They should negotiate with suppliers to keep prices low or find alternative suppliers if necessary. Retailers need to become experts in the supply chain to accept or reject price increases intelligently. They should understand the value of the goods they sell and create quicker bundles or special promotions that bring more value to customers.", "Episode 4.md-18": "Retailers can also do value-based pricing if they understand the value of what they buy and the value to customers. This involves pricing products based on the value they provide to customers rather than simply pricing them based on cost. By doing so, retailers can capture more value for themselves and provide a better experience for their customers.\n\nQ: What role does technology play in pricing strategy?", "Episode 4.md-19": "A: Technology plays a crucial role in pricing strategy, particularly when it comes to value-based pricing. Through technology, retailers can implement various pricing tactics, such as bonding, versioning, assortments, time-based dynamic pricing, special promotions, etc. Therefore, technology is necessary for retailers to do value-based pricing. By using data and analytics, retailers can better understand customer behavior and preferences, which can help inform their pricing decisions.", "Episode 4.md-20": "For example, retailers can use machine learning algorithms to analyze data and determine optimal prices for their products. They can also use pricing optimization software to automate pricing decisions and ensure that prices are adjusted in real-time based on market conditions.\n\nQ: What issues do you see with pricing strategy during the holiday season?", "Episode 4.md-21": "Q: What issues do you see with pricing strategy during the holiday season?\n\nA: Pricing strategy during the holiday season can be particularly challenging for retailers. Retailers need to pay attention to how far they push their prices and whether there is a true willingness to pay. Regular continuous market research is necessary to determine willingness to pay. Retailers should also look at trends to determine pricing strategies. Trends change rapidly, and retailers need to adapt to new trends quickly.", "Episode 4.md-22": "Another issue that retailers face during the holiday season is the potential for supply chain disruptions. If retailers are not able to obtain the products they need, they may need to adjust their pricing strategies accordingly. Finally, retailers should also consider the impact of promotions and discounts on their bottom line. While promotions can drive sales, they can also cut into profits if not executed properly.\n\nQ: What can B2B and B2C retailers learn from SaaS pricing strategies?", "Episode 4.md-23": "Q: What can B2B and B2C retailers learn from SaaS pricing strategies?\n\nA: Both B2B and B2C retailers can learn from SaaS companies' pricing strategies. SaaS companies are known for their innovative pricing models, such as subscription-based services and usage-based pricing. B2B and B2C retailers can apply similar models to their businesses to increase customer loyalty and generate recurring revenue.", "Episode 4.md-24": "SaaS companies can also learn from retailers about bundling, promotional pricing, and the value of the goods they sell. Retailers are skilled at creating attractive bundles and promotions that encourage customers to make additional purchases. Additionally, retailers have a deep understanding of the value of the goods they sell and can communicate that value effectively to their customers.", "Episode 4.md-25": "Q: I'm really fascinated by the sales pricing strategy you talked about with Best Buy and this upselling strategy. So you buy an iPhone or a Samsung phone, and then you understand you need the case. That's genius. Is that something that Plastus does?", "Episode 4.md-26": "A: Yeah, and they're also Best Buy also bought the Geek Squad, so now they're offering maintenance and service and installation. So you could buy a Ring camera for $84 and then install it for you for another 125, and then they sell you a warranty. So before you know it, you went from 84 to 300, but you do nothing. It's a service economy. You know, someone shows up and installs that for you, and you're ready to go, right? And in the future, are we gonna maybe offer data-enabled solutions? So the key is how do we price this? So now we get into the price match, and now if you're the only one to do this, you have a great advantage, right?", "Episode 4.md-27": "Q: And you have the key to create great bundles with hardware installation and service and insurance and warranties. But imagine the pricing power.", "Episode 4.md-28": "A: Yes, it's always easier to be the only one, but not always. Well, you gotta get it right. You gotta do the right pricing strategy. You gotta, obviously, understand the value you bring and then price it right so that you attract people. But when I went to the store, I originally wanted to buy a Ring camera, and before I knew it because I'm not a very handyman, I bought the whole package.", "Episode 4.md-29": "\u200b\u200bThe salesperson asked me the right questions, such as whether I could install the product myself, what had happened to my old product, and what was important to me. They provided a solution for me, which made me more loyal to the company because I paid for better service and warranty.\n\nQ: That's interesting. How can retailers use this approach for different products?", "Episode 4.md-30": "A: Retailers should focus on systems, services, and maintenance to attract customers rather than just passing through products from suppliers to consumers. For example, Staples started by selling office supplies but now offers printing solutions and design services. They attract small business owners who also buy office supplies while they're in the store. The same goes for pet food stores that offer grooming and pet-sitting services. A great value-based pricing strategy requires a great value proposition and understanding the competition's pricing.", "Episode 4.md-31": "Q: How do you recommend keeping up with the competition?\n\nA: You should know your competition's price level on a daily basis and make pricing decisions based on real-time information. Staples is one of our clients, and they use competitive data to inform their pricing decisions. You need to be relevant and have an innovation strategy, a great value proposition, and awesome pricing technology to be successful in retail.\n\nQ: Lastly, could you recommend any literature, media, or podcasts about pricing?", "Episode 4.md-32": "Q: Lastly, could you recommend any literature, media, or podcasts about pricing?\n\nA: As a pricing expert, it's important to understand what software providers in pricing are talking about. You can follow thought leaders and attend webinars by software vendors like Competera to stay informed.", "Episode 1.md-0": "Our today\u2019s guest is Dr Markus Husemann-Kopetzky - pricing advisor, researcher and educator, ex. Amazon Senior Manager for Pricing and Business Analytic, Founder of the Price Management Institute and author of the Handbook on the Psychology of Pricing and the (lovely) Pricing Nuggets. Dr Husemann-Kopetzkyhas shared how some retailers win during uncertainty in the market and why an elasticity-based approach to pricing is the key to success.", "Episode 1.md-1": "Q: You are a pricing expert with a profound experience in the field who keeps a pulse on many industry players. Could you shed light on how the approach to pricing changed over the last decade?", "Episode 1.md-2": "A: Yes, thank you for this excellent question. My expertise lies in the e-commerce space, and I observe that over the last ten-plus years, companies have increasingly moved to a data-driven approach to pricing. And why didn't they start with a data-driven approach, you ask? That would be an excellent question. Most online stores began as a kind of branch to the offline channel. So there's a big brick-and-mortar store, and they founded a different legal entity: their e-commerce channel. And this e-commerce channel starts with the same pricing approach as the brick-and-mortar store. But over the years, the online store has grown bigger and become more or less the pricing lab to the brick-and-mortar store. So retailers developed more sophisticated models and infused a large amount of data into their pricing strategy. To find the optimal price, they started with rule-based pricing, moved on to machine learning and are experimenting with artificial intelligence, for example, based on price elasticity estimates. And I think we haven't reached full maturity yet.", "Episode 1.md-3": "Not 100% of all companies are applying a scaled approach to pricing, not even a database approach. From one case study I did, a major player with a 5+ billion-dollar business still uploaded an Excel sheet with prices once a month. And that's crazy. In terms of model sophistication, for those who use data for pricing decisions, almost 100% use pricing rules. But moving beyond rules is still a work in progress. That's what I experienced.\n\nQ: What is the future of pricing?", "Episode 1.md-4": "A: I think the future of pricing is very scientific and bright. We are not talking about personalized pricing, meaning an individualized price so that every customer has a different price for the same product. But what I see are three ways of development. First, pricing will become, as I said, more data-driven. It's not about the Procurement Department taking the procurement price and adding their target margin. That's gone. It's about using demand, price and cross-price elasticities. Second, once applying database pricing, the models will become more sophisticated, and we will see more companies using them. The third way, and maybe I'm biased because I research a lot about psychological and behavioral pricing, will be a professional and consciously chosen frame around the price presentation beyond changing the price number.", "Episode 1.md-5": "So, for example, if a customer, who is conscious of quality, goes to the retailer's website and searches for a product, they want to see high-quality items first in their search results: good stellar brands and good reviews. Then you have price-conscious customers. They want to see relevant search results based on what's on sale with a little \u201con-sale\u201d sign.", "Episode 1.md-6": "Of course, we also have individualized promotions. Say there are 1,000 items on promotion that won't fit in a single promotional email. So retailers are to choose 30 items with the highest probability that the customer will buy. You don't change the sale price per se but make an individualized offer. \n\nOn the marketing side, of course, retailers can go one step further. If there is a promotional budget, you can send individualized rebates and discounts to customers, indicating a 'price for you'.", "Episode 1.md-7": "This means price differentiation. And, of course, your neighbor might have a different set of discounted items, but on average, both customers have items that fit the most and they receive a promo price that the other person might not receive. But it's still fair because both have different benefits, and nobody is taking advantage of.", "Episode 1.md-8": "And that's what I see in the future. More usage of data in price decisions, more sophisticated models when making those decisions, and moving into psychological pricing by using hard analytical skills to optimize this soft art of pricing.\n\nQ: Is personalized pricing in it?", "Episode 1.md-9": "Q: Is personalized pricing in it?\n\nA: If we're talking about individualized pricing, like optimal pricing on an individual customer level, we quickly run into the perception of price unfairness. I observed such cases in the airline industry: press F5 and update your website or open a secured page, and you find a lower price.", "Episode 1.md-10": "And that's not cool. Even if a customer receives a lower price and feels that other customers otherwise would pay a higher price, a client gets away with a bad feeling of price discrimination. That is not fair. Although you are benefiting this time, you still wonder whether you would benefit the next time and whether this behavior of the seller is actually fair. You might attribute an unfair behavior to the seller and this leaves you with a negative impression of the retailer.", "Episode 1.md-11": "That's my passionate opinion on personalized pricing and price discrimination. \n\nWith the retail environment being shaken by surging inflation, supply chain disruptions, etc., what significant changes do you anticipate in the retail space?\n\nIn the next couple of years, I expect two major shocks. We already see surging inflation and supply chain disruptions, and their conjunction means two things. \n\nFirst, inflation means rising costs for retailers. This leads to substantial pressure on margins.", "Episode 1.md-12": "Second, inflation is closely related to fear of recession. We have people, consumers, and customers who earn less in net terms. Inflation is eating up pretty much their disposal income. And in recessionary and inflationary times, we see customers get more prudent with their money, become more price conscious, avoid excessive debt and try to save even more of their available income, just for the bad times. Following this train of thought, they postpone purchases of durable goods. If you don't need a washing machine today immediately, then let's buy it next year \u2014 the same accounts for holidays. Customers either downgrade and choose a shorter or less expensive destination or postpone holidays at all. They reduce impulse purchases, become less loyal to brand stores and go to discounters. They look for deals and lower prices.", "Episode 1.md-13": "So we see a shift in preferences and demand, meaning looking for price-entry products and private label alternatives rather than for branded products. The demand for some items might shrink in unit terms, not so much in revenue terms, because inflation-driven prices still increase.\n\nRising procurement costs cause margin pressure from below and price-conscious customers drive ASPs down causing margin pressure from above.", "Episode 1.md-14": "Q: What strategy would you recommend to retailers who want to thrive in these ever-changing conditions?\n\nA: My recommendation first is to get an overview of what is happening. Because not all retailers are affected the same, some retailers might even win. Zara, for example, is increasing revenues and profits. Sports retailers focusing on elite or expert equipment are also not affected.", "Episode 1.md-15": "The first thing I recommend is to get an overview of what is happening, get an inflation information center, catch early signals, and collect all your data to understand how the current challenges affect you now and what the consequences are in the future.", "Episode 1.md-16": "Then extract insights and conclusions from this data and quantify the different drivers of the inflation impact. Retailers face headwinds as well as tailwinds. And that's more or less the best part of the analysis about inflation impact drivers. Inflation is a big issue now, indeed. It is a kind of the big elephant retailers have to slice.", "Episode 1.md-17": "So what I mean is to break down the biggest inflation-driven challenges and address them surgically. That is the third step, set up projects that address the key headwinds of inflation.\n\nThank you. So probably, the secret to success is just slicing the elephant.", "Episode 1.md-18": "Exactly. But if our readers asked me about three emergency strategies to keep profits high, I think currently, it's about keeping the head above water. I would suggest running a profitability sprint first and increasing unnecessary low prices. And if your competitor crawling mechanism isn't updating frequently enough, all competitors might have raised their price already, and you're still involuntarily price leading in the market. So honestly, if you don't crawl all your relevant competitors early enough or often enough, and your frequency of price changes is not often enough, you end up on the sideline.", "Episode 1.md-19": "The first step is raising your profitability level by implementing elasticity-based pricing.\n\nSecond, I would suggest implementing any price differentiation, for example via rebates or discounts.", "Episode 1.md-20": "Second, I would suggest implementing any price differentiation, for example via rebates or discounts.\n\nAnd the third has nothing so much to do with pricing. Still, you can use your pricing data and competitor pricing data available in your pricing function to negotiate procurement prices with your suppliers. So the third strategy is to systematically manage procurement prices and the vendor relationships you have with your suppliers.\n\nThese are the three things I would recommend as emergency measures.", "Episode 1.md-21": "These are the three things I would recommend as emergency measures.\n\nWhat hard skills should a Pricing/Category manager have?\n\nThey need a solid understanding and passion for numbers in terms of hard skills. So they need the tools, basic statistics and a solid understanding of the benefits of experiments, for example, quasi-experimental designs. Pricing managers need to understand how \"changing something leads to something\". Master studies with a deep dive into statistics would actually help.", "Episode 1.md-22": "The pricing team gets the pricing-relevant data, analyzes them and extracts specific strategies. The next step is bringing the data into a context that is related to business. Then they need to explain the results to somebody who's not so much a number person. And that's a very empathetic soft skill, honestly.", "Episode 1.md-23": "In my understanding, pricing teams are usually very small and somehow alone. Because they have such specialized knowledge, they don't have anybody to talk to and to discuss challenges on eye-level. My experience is that personal, technical development is reduced to self-study. Internal or external seminars are usually too general to be helpful. This is an honest challenge for pricing teams.\n\nQ: Could you share advice on pricing resources that inspire you?", "Episode 1.md-24": "A: Yes, I'm very old-school, so I read books because they have much more space to elaborate on thoughts than a 30 minutes podcast. I find it usually inspiring to talk to fellow seasoned experts like Hermann Simon or Stephan Liozu. These are excellent resources, their books and conversations with them. I try to read all books that get published about pricing. And if there is a need to understand the value of pricing, I recommend The 1% Windfall: How Successful Companies Use Price to Profit and Grow by Rafi Mohammed. And what I'm currently reading and like a lot is Price For Growth: A Revolutionary Step-By-Step Approach to Massively Impact the Value of Your Company by Leveraging Focused Pricing Strategies by Jeff Robinson.", "Episode 5.md-0": "Q: Hello, and welcome to the #Pricing_Heroes podcast by Competera. This is a series of interviews with the best and class retail pricing experts driving their companies' bottom metrics and the retail industry as a whole. Today's guest is James Tenser, Retail Tech Marketing Strategist, the President of VSN Media, and a Top 100 Retail Influencer for 2023 by Rethink Retail. \n\nA: I'm very glad to be here. Thank you for having me.", "Episode 5.md-1": "A: I'm very glad to be here. Thank you for having me. \n\nQ: Great. So first things first, and I'm here with my first question, which concerns rising eggs prices. Of course, the increasing price of eggs is on everybody's mind here in the U.S. this month. So how are FMCG retailers responding? Can they preserve a positive price image while still finding sufficient margins across the entire assortment?", "Episode 5.md-2": "A: Egg prices have increased significantly due to factors such as avian flu, higher production costs, and energy costs. Retailers have tried to maintain prices while adjusting markups and seeking alternative sources, but the reality is that there are fewer eggs on the shelves and at a higher cost. Retailers have had to communicate with their shoppers about the price increase, and some may have sacrificed margins to maintain the bigger picture, including the linkages and interaction effects of selling eggs. Retailers have to think strategically about what price changes mean for the whole shopper and the basket and avoid increasing prices on shoppers as much as possible to avoid impacting baskets and trips and possibly their image on the way shoppers perceive them.\nI think that prices may not go back down to what they were a year ago, as shoppers have gotten used to a different ceiling on price, and general food inflation is also a contributor.", "Episode 5.md-3": "Q: How do you imagine the future of pricing? As AI (thanks to ChatGPT) has had its second limelight over the last decade, retailers are even more determined to employ it through the first-hand customer experience: we already see digital fitting rooms, digital clothing, and stores in Metaverse. This year NRF experts widely discussed the implementation of AI/ML to the margin drivers (and savers) like pricing and inventory management. Do you think this trend will stay with us, or will some companies never outsource such things?", "Episode 5.md-4": "A: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in pricing decisions is a promising trend that can make routine decisions easier for human workers. AI can be trained to make a large percentage of routine decisions while freeing human beings for the decisions that require judgment and experience. It is important to train AI with the same sets of considerations that human beings use. AI decision tools can help make many of those routine decisions better and improve the quality of the job. However, human workers should not be replaced by AI as they are needed to train and monitor AI. Retail pricing decisions are complex and are bound by rules and algorithms. Changing one price may impact how other products sell, making it overwhelming for human workers to make decisions. AI can help automate pricing and make it more efficient, but human workers are still necessary to ensure that the AI is trained properly and monitored. The adoption curve of AI in pricing decisions will resemble that of price optimization, which was once regarded with skepticism but is now widely used in retail.", "Episode 5.md-5": "Q: There is an important linkage between price optimization and inventory accuracy. This is a bit more technical, but in the wake of recent supply chain challenges, on-shelf availability has been under duress. What limitations does this place on our pricing decision processes? How does superior inventory accuracy enable better pricing decisions?", "Episode 5.md-6": "A: As someone who has worked with both price optimization and inventory management, I see them as inseparable. Poor on-shelf availability can distort demand signals and make it difficult to determine pricing. On the other hand, superior inventory accuracy can enable better pricing decisions because it reflects actual demand rather than distorted demand caused by poor availability. It also enables more accurate measurement of demand impact and better category decisions. These disciplines need to be locked down, viewed as an ecosystem, and prepared to work together to make better choices and be more resilient when external forces intervene. Retailers should not focus on just one area but manage their business as a whole.", "Episode 5.md-7": "Q: And more broadly, there is much industry activity around \"personalized pricing\" -  deals offered within the context of a loyalty program or digital shopping encounter. This is a form of stealth pricing that can be difficult for competitors to track. What advantages does this practice bring? What guardrails need to be in place?", "Episode 5.md-8": "A: Personalized pricing is a powerful tool for retailers to build trust and loyalty with their customers. By tailoring prices to individual shoppers based on past behavior, preferences, and traits, retailers can create a more meaningful relationship with customers and drive sales and profits. Personalized pricing is often used in the context of a loyalty program or digital shopping experience, where shoppers can see deals and promotions that are specifically targeted to them. This approach allows retailers to identify shopper behaviors that they want to encourage and develop, while also guarding against practices that erode trust, such as frequent price changes and overly aggressive deals. However, guardrails need to be in place to ensure that personalized pricing is used ethically and transparently, and that it does not discriminate against certain groups of shoppers or lead to anti-competitive behavior.", "Episode 5.md-9": "Q:  And my last question here: what literature, media, and podcasts about pricing and retail do you recommend to anyone interested in the latest retail and pricing trends?", "Episode 5.md-10": "A: For literature, media, and podcasts about pricing and retail, I recommend RetailWire.com and the Rethink Retail platform. RetailWire.com is a discussion website with a Brain Trust of over 70 unpaid commentators who offer their perspectives on a curated set of articles each morning. Rethink Retail focuses on podcasts, video interviews, and trade show coverage and has a strong focus on personal interviews and trade show coverage. Other publishers covering the retail industry include RIS news, and the Retail Dive group. It's important to stay informed about the retail industry, as it's a complex and vast industry that affects the entire planet.

So thank you once again. \n\nA:You're quite welcome. This is a privilege for me, and I'm grateful to you for making it possible. \nAs you can tell, I  really enjoy sharing insights on these subjects. \nIt's my favorite thing. So thank you very much. Been quite a pleasure. \n\nQ: Thank you, James.", "Episode 2.md-0": "Hello and welcome to Pricing Heroes podcast by Competera. It is a series of interviews with the best-in-class retail pricing experts driving their companies' bottom metrics and, therefore, the retail industry.", "Episode 2.md-1": "Today's guest is Dr. Yola Engler - Lead Group Pricing at Signa Sports United based in Berlin. \nSIGNA Sports United is an NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) listed specialist online sports retail company based in Berlin, Germany. They own companies and brands in various sports, including bike, tennis, outdoor, and team sports. They sell equipment and apparel via our 100 own online stores, collaborate with 500+ independent brick-and-mortar shops, and partner with over 1000 sports brands.", "Episode 2.md-2": "Q: Hi, Yola, and thank you for joining us.\n\n\nA: Hi, Olena. Thanks for having me. \n\n\nQ: For our listeners, we're both speaking from Berlin, so today is the closest podcast, location-wise, we have ever recorded. First, please tell us more about yourself, your background, and your positions as a lead pricing and inventory manager.", "Episode 2.md-3": "A: Sure. My background is in economics. I studied economics and then did my Ph.D. in behavioral economics, where I investigated how psychological factors impact decision-making.\nAnd after a small detour via consulting, I found my way to e-commerce pricing at home24, a large online player for furniture in Germany. There, I took over the Pricing and inventory management team later. But it was, in particular, the pricing topic that I fell in love with as it combines an analytical and data-driven approach with business knowledge and psychological effects that I studied during my PhD. So, I decided to focus on pricing and took over the role of Group Pricing Lead at Signa Sports United around a year ago.", "Episode 2.md-4": "Q: It's fascinating to hear about the psychological side of the area because I've been having some conversations with the experts in the field as well, and many of them are now connecting the psychological effects and pricing, especially during inflation.\nAnd here comes the first question: What are your and your team's major wins throughout 2022?", "Episode 2.md-5": "A: 2022 was a year of platform modernization and optimization for us. We migrated most of our shops to a new pricing platform which now enables us to explore the field of machine learning and also allows us to experiment at scale.\nThe biggest win was the migration itself because the team needed to migrate more than 50 shops. But also we were able to do the first tests using machine learning algorithms, and the results were already very promising.\nNow, we are all super excited that we have the foundation in place to really experiment further in the next year and get the best out of the new technologies. \nAnd then there is another win. While migrating, we also optimized our competitor data scraping frequencies and saved significant costs without harming our revenues or margins.\nWhat did we do? When I started at Signa Sports, there was this mindset that \"more scraping is always better,\" which I think is quite common. I guess everyone has in mind that Amazon is changing prices several times an hour and is scraping competitor prices many times a day, so that must be right. \nBut scraping also takes effort, data resources, and costs money. And for many products and categories, it is not worth scraping competitors daily, let alone several times a day, because the benefit is too little or nonexistent. \nFor example, most e-commerce players have a longtail with articles with few views and even fewer sales. For those, the price impact is typically very low. \nAnother example is categories for which the purchasing decision is typically a longer process, and therefore, prices are relatively stable. For example, a bike. Typically it's not an impulse purchase, right? People return to the webshop several times before purchasing. And if you change prices too often, you drive your customers crazy. So, we observe relatively stable prices throughout the market for these categories. If I now scrape my competitors six times a day, I will just get six times the same price. \nOn the other hand, if you look at electronics, where customers are used to constantly changing prices, scraping and pricing several times a day may be worthwhile. \nTherefore, we developed an optimization function that balances the cost and benefits of scraping and allows us to determine the best scraping frequency for each category, subcategory, and product.", "Episode 2.md-6": "Q: That sounds really interesting. I enjoyed the example with a bike because there are some categories you must understand whether you want to buy this model or this particular one.\nOr sometimes you have an impulse to go and buy a new pair of leggings, for example. Or the new pulse metering device. And typically, the less money you spend, the quicker you make the buying decisions.\nAnd with 70 online sites and 500 partner shops serving over 7 million customers worldwide, are all prices managed by the headquarters?\nOr is every region independent in terms of pricing management?", "Episode 2.md-7": "A: It's something in the middle. Not every region or shop does its pricing, but we rather have one pricing team per company. And these \"local\" pricing teams are very independent and free in their operational pricing decisions. \nOn the other hand, on the holding side, we focus on establishing the pricing infrastructure and a learning platform for all these local pricing teams.\nWhy do we do this?\nTypically, each of our companies is specialized in one particular sport. So, we have one company for bikes, one for tennis, one for outdoors, one for running and so on. And being specialized means that they are also the true experts in their particular industry: they know when the big tournaments are, who the main competitors are, what the seasons are, the must-have products, etc. And our local pricing teams use this industry knowledge to enrich their pricing.\nAdditionally, the local teams are very close to all the business developments in their respective company: they know the warehouse and supply chain situation. They are informed about campaigns or new product introductions. And they also know their data best. \nSo, the companies typically have expert knowledge, and they have company knowledge and thus can fine-tune the pricing much better to their particular needs and react much faster because they are the first ones to know when something in the market happens.\nOn the other hand, some topics don't need to be reinvented by each company. These include a good pricing infrastructure with good pricing and competitor data, a pricing tool, smart algorithms, and also a controlling and analytics platform. And that's what we focus on in the holding. We provide the basics for all the local pricing teams in the companies, which they then adapt to their needs.\nAdditionally, we are building a small pricing academy as we strongly believe in testing and learning. The academy is the platform for pricing managers to share their learnings and best practices and learn or get impulses from external experts.", "Episode 2.md-8": "Q: That's interesting that you put so much effort and attention into educating and sharing knowledge throughout the company, vertically and horizontally. \nMoving to broader things now: the whole world is shaken by rising inflation.\nAnd we have it in Germany, the United States, and Europe. Considering the inflation, what are your thoughts on the current sports and outdoor markets?\nHow did it change? What's the pattern right now?", "Episode 2.md-9": "A: Also, the outdoor and sports sector, in general, is very much affected by inflation. As in most industries, we face much-increased purchase prices.\nHowever, the more significant impact for us is the very low consumer sentiment, particularly since most of our products are non-necessity goods like bikes or tennis rackets. And in times of tight budgets, purchases of these categories are often postponed.\nHowever, having that said, we actually see it more as a short-term bump as the huge megatrends underlying our business model will remain.\nAnd by that, I mean the trend for health and fitness, for being more sportive and active, the trend towards e-mobility and e-bikes, and the trend towards digitalization and e-commerce. \nWe obviously still need to manage the current situation very tightly, and it is not easy for anyone; but, at the same time, we also see it as a chance to build the infrastructure & processes for the future so that we are ready to scale once the economic situation eases again.", "Episode 2.md-10": "Q: It's now time to reflect on it and build it sustainably, making you more powerful in the future. Definitely. And you're saying that your team and the pricing teams throughout are managing the situation with inflation tightly.\nIs there advice you can give to your colleagues who are also in the same situation with inflation right now?", "Episode 2.md-11": "A: I'd generally recommend an analytical and granular approach because every industry is affected differently, not just every industry but even each category. Ask yourself:\nHow big are the price increases?\nHow elastic is the demand?\nWhat's my inventory situation?\nHow stable is the supply?\nWhat are competitors doing?\nHow big is my pricing power?\nAnd so on.\nYou need to analyze your particular situation and determine a targeted pricing response. Don't take the 'one-fits-all' approach.", "Episode 2.md-12": "Q: Now, a lot of retailers, especially in the United States, and maybe you'll tell me as well about the German market, are going for excessive promo campaigns.\nWe saw this second Amazon Prime Day, and Target is starting the holiday season early this year. We see that retailers are going for excessive promo campaigns that put their margins under so much pressure.\nBut what stands behind is the full warehouses that need to be cleared off to put in more merchandise. So, this usually leads to blanket discounts and margin losses. So, what stands behind wise promo management?", "Episode 2.md-13": "A: This is precisely the one-fits-all solution. And yes, you also see it a lot in Germany. I just read an article that now even Ikea is advertising excessive discounts. And Ikea was typically the prime example of avoiding any discount battles. It looks like companies fall into panic mode to somehow get rid of their excess inventory. \nRegarding your question, what does good promo management look like? I would answer it just as your previous question: take targeted pricing decisions depending on the market you are operating in: are my categories and articles seasonal? Are my customers price-sensitive? Do I have overstock?\nBeing more particular: For each category, you should ask yourself why customers are not buying and whether you can even influence their buying decision through the price. For example, you may have thought about buying an e-bike, which is relatively expensive. Like 2000-3000\u20ac. But now, money is scarce given your increased cost for groceries, gas, et cetera. So, you start saving where it is easiest, and you will likely not even look at e-bike offers anymore. No matter if the e-bike is at full price or at a 20% discount. On the other hand, people still looking to buy an e-bike are probably quite well off and would buy the bike at full price.\nSo, ensure that discounting has a revenue impact, not just throwing away money. \nAlso, check where you really have overstocks and how supply chains will develop.\nFor bikes, for example, we are still not sure how stable supply chains are. So, keeping more safety stock than usual might make sense.\nSumming it up: Take a granular and targeted discounting approach to avoid unnecessary discounts and to save at least some margin.", "Episode 2.md-14": "Q: Definitely. Thank you for such a profound answer. And we're recording this episode a week before Black Friday. I'm curious about what we're going to see this year. Maybe this will be the craziest Black Friday.", "Episode 2.md-15": "A: I actually think so. Many companies have already started and are trying to be first in place before the big discount battle starts around Black Friday. Many extended the period from Black Friday to Black Friday week to Black Friday month.\nSo, we'll see many discounts flying around, and discounting might also continue until Christmas. \nIf you have some money left to spend, there should be good deals on the table.\nFor companies, it will be a tough year, particularly margin-wise.", "Episode 2.md-16": "Q: Something to explore in a couple of months. I wanted to ask you the next question because you have such a profound experience. What are the key factors behind effective price management?", "Episode 2.md-17": "A: Let me surprise you with a high-level approach. \nFor me, effective price management always starts with an aligned business and pricing strategy. Who are my target customers? What is my price positioning? And what price image do I want to reflect? Am I more in the discount sector? Am I more on the luxury brand side? \nSo, targets should be clear. \nAnd then, for price management, I think there should also be a good price organization built around it. So for me, this consists of two pillars. \nFirst, there needs to be one single point of accountability. We often see that many people in different departments touch prices, but nobody is ultimately accountable.\nAnd second, a good pricing organization involves a pricing steering committee or a pricing council which ensures that everyone with a stake in pricing is involved in the big pricing decisions and takes aligned actions. Often, this involves Finance, Marketing, Sales, Product or Category Management, and Pricing, of course. \nThird, especially when selling lots of products, you need a good pricing platform to handle lots and lots of data efficiently and effectively. This includes high-quality data, automated data flows, good pricing software, smart algorithms, and a controlling and analytics platform.\nThe platform gives you the toolset to implement your pricing strategies and adapt them quickly to changing market conditions. \nBut then, most importantly, you need to test, test, test, and learn, learn, learn. Analyze your data as much as you can. Your pricing platform should allow you to move away from manual price setting towards analyzing your data, setting up tests, and trying new strategies.\nYou can learn so much from your data, and many pricing strategies exist, so test and adapt them to your needs. A strategy that worked well for someone else might not work for you. So try and learn from your data and become smarter every day. \nPricing is rather a process and not a one-time task.", "Episode 2.md-18": "Q: And actually, the next question comes from the answer. How do you see the future of pricing thing?", "Episode 2.md-19": "A: I think the future of pricing is very exciting. The future of pricing will still be data, lots of data. I think data-driven pricing sounds nearly old, but I think there's still a lot of potential from what I see in our companies and others.\nThere is still much room for improvement in ensuring that all pricing-relevant KPIs are available and that data flows are automated; I still see a lot of manual copy and pasting of data from different sources.\nAnd once the data is available, all these smart algorithms, including machine learning and neural networks, become more relevant because now you have data the algorithms can learn from. So, as soon as we have the data in place, I think smart algorithms will be the next big thing. \nYet, I strongly believe that algorithms and humans have to work hand-in-hand to make the most of the data. There is no perfect algorithm yet, but lots of human knowledge is needed to constantly improve algorithms in addition to their self-learning capabilities.\nAdditionally, we will see deeper integration with performance marketing as the two disciplines are highly interdependent. For example, depending on how competitive my price is today, I will get more impressions on Google Shopping. Yet, the higher impressions and likely sales may not necessarily offset the reduced margin. We, therefore, should optimize price and marketing bidding together. However, this is not easy, and it will take time for good solutions to emerge. Yet, we see the first steps in that direction.", "Episode 2.md-20": "Q: I like your vision about the future of pricing. It seems really bright. It's like a harmonic conjunction of person and algorithm.\nAnd I have one more question, which is usually much of an interest from our audience. What are your recommendations on books and podcasts, media, or something that creates environments, whether it's about professional or personal development? So, what literature, media, podcasts, or other sources of information do you use about pricing and retail do you recommend to your colleagues?", "Episode 2.md-21": "A: I think my biggest recommendation is to go on LinkedIn and follow price experts and consultancies, et cetera. I mostly get my inspiration from there. They're usually posting interesting webinars, articles, and book recommendations. \nThere's also a community. And what I really like most is that they often discuss real-life pricing examples. Books are often very theoretical, and then you always miss a connection: \"Okay, sounds easy in theory, but actually, it's super difficult to implement.\" So discussing real-life examples and hearing different opinions is most valuable for me. And this is where I get most of my information. \nI'd look at a couple of pricing experts, consultancies, tools providers, and the professional pricing society. This typically gives you a starting point to connect to more people and follow the ones you like. The algorithms usually allow you to follow people based on what and who you're following and connecting with what you're reading. So here we have it again, the smart and harmonic conjunction between people and algorithms.", "Episode 2.md-22": "Q: I'm out of my questions. Thank you once again for being my guest today, and it was a great pleasure to speak with you about everything. \n\n\nA: Thank you very much for all your interesting questions. It was lots of fun discussing the issues with you. And let's see how Black Friday goes.", "Episode 6.md-0": "OS: Hello and welcome to the #Pricing_Heroes podcast by Competera, where we interview the best retail pricing experts who drive their company's bottom metrics and the retail industry as a whole. Today's guest is Zen Ore, Executive Manager of Commercial Pricing Strategy at one of the world's biggest grocery retailers.\n\nZO: Hi, Olena. Thank you for having me.\n\nOS: Could you tell us about your background and experience?", "Episode 6.md-1": "ZO: I'm originally from Israel and moved to Australia nine years ago. I worked in hospitality in Israel, doing commercial analytics, business modeling, and consulting for commercial growth. In Perth, I worked in the petrol industry and grew from Operations and Commercial Manager to Head of Pricing and Commercial Strategy. When I moved to Sydney five years ago, I started my business, \"Pricing Is A Thing,\" offering pricing as a service. I'm also a mentor of The Boosting Female Founders Initiative, which supports female founders with commercial pricing and have been teaching pricing strategy in Masterclass for General Assembly for the past two years.", "Episode 6.md-2": "OS: You have worked in various industries, so how can pricing experience in one industry be beneficial for another?", "Episode 6.md-3": "ZO: There is transferable knowledge and skill in pricing and commercial strategy, including segmentation, commercial trade-offs, and understanding customer buying decisions. The core understanding of any industry is to optimize what you are trying to achieve with pricing, such as quantity, volume, velocity, revenue, profit, or margin. An interesting story to tell is when my team and I did market research for a petrol station in Margaret River. We found a correlation between people owning dogs and those who own a muscle car or a car that uses premium diesel. We decided to introduce premium diesel, a dog wash and lowered the premium diesel price to attract customers, which resulted in a 6-cent per liter difference higher than competitors without impacting volume on premium diesel.", "Episode 6.md-4": "OS: That's fascinating. How do you approach pricing when there are multiple channels, such as online and offline?", "Episode 6.md-5": "ZO: When there are multiple channels, you need to understand the value proposition of each channel and the customer buying journey. You also need to consider the cost to serve each channel and how they affect each other. One approach is to use dynamic pricing, which adjusts prices based on demand, supply, and competitive landscape. You can also use differential pricing, which sets different prices for different channels, such as higher prices for convenience or immediacy. However, it's essential to communicate the pricing strategy clearly to customers and ensure fairness and transparency.", "Episode 6.md-6": "OS: So, what are common mistakes that you see businesses make with their approach to pricing?", "Episode 6.md-7": "ZO: Well, I work with an interesting mix of customers, from medium to large corporate, to really small businesses. Smaller businesses or new startups usually suffer from low confidence in pricing. This usually comes from a relatively low understanding of pricing and strategy. They start from being an expert in their field, such as a chef or a programmer, but pricing is not something they pick up on the way while opening their business.", "Episode 6.md-8": "OS: That makes sense. So, what are some key things they should understand?\n\nZO: There's a lack of understanding of the basic holy triangle of value perception, willingness to pay, and price sensitivity. If you don't understand them deeply and fundamentally, it's going to be very hard for you to break down your business into a commercial structure that can generate a good profit.\n\nOS: I can see that. What about deal negotiation?", "Episode 6.md-9": "OS: I can see that. What about deal negotiation?\n\nZO: That's something not a lot of managers have or develop. Negotiation, whether you are in B2B or B2C, is a basic skill. You need to have the backbone to defend your price and be willing to negotiate the tradeoff between the value you provide and the price you are charging.\n\nOS: It seems like soft skills are really important here too.", "Episode 6.md-10": "OS: It seems like soft skills are really important here too.\n\nZO: Definitely. Soft skills are crucial for business owners and pricing managers. Nobody cares how smart you are if you don't know how to communicate it and make it relevant to them.\n\nOS: What are some other common mistakes you see when it comes to pricing?", "Episode 6.md-11": "OS: What are some other common mistakes you see when it comes to pricing?\n\nZO: A very common mistake is leaving pricing to the last minute and just copying competitors without understanding your own value proposition. You don't have economies of scale, and your margin is never greater than the competitor you are looking at. It's also not a good idea to copy your competitor's pricing model. You need to charge for what you do best, especially if you're a new business.", "Episode 6.md-12": "OS: What do you think are the key factors behind an effective pricing strategy and management?", "Episode 6.md-13": "ZO: I would say one of the most important factors is investing in your own business. If you don't have the budget to hire a higher-priced consultant, then look within your company for someone in marketing, commercial, or analytics who has an interest and talent in pricing. Teach them, consult with them, buy them a book or send them to a course, and have a mentor. This will help you increase your pricing power without having to pay a lot of money for outside help.", "Episode 6.md-14": "Another important factor is to calculate the cost of doing nothing. If you're not optimizing your pricing, what are you losing? Look at the cost of not taking action and see if it's worth it to save on expenses like hiring a consultant.\n\nAs for the key factors of an effective pricing strategy, it all starts with analyzing your company, your features, your users, your usage metrics, and your customers. If you can't analyze all of those, then at least analyze something to have more than just an opinion.", "Episode 6.md-15": "The three pricing questions you should ask yourself are: what am I charging for, how do I charge, and what is the price point? Many companies ignore the first two questions and only focus on the price point. But research has shown that how customers pay is far more important than how much they pay. You need to know your customers, their buying drivers beyond price, their price sensitivity, and the Holy Trinity of value, perception, willingness to pay, and price sensitivity. Spend as much time as you can on this.", "Episode 6.md-16": "OS: You mentioned subscriptions earlier. What can startups learn from big B2B and B2C companies in terms of pricing?", "Episode 6.md-17": "ZO: When you're a big corporate company, you have the incentive to invest tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in research and business intelligence to optimize your pricing. But as a small business, you don't necessarily need that level of accuracy in the first one or two years. If you get your pricing right by 10 or 15%, you may lose money or customers, but the impact won't be as big. As a new business, you're more agile in measuring what's happening and reacting quickly. So startups should learn from big corporations to analyze and ask all the right questions, but they should also move quickly, get a pricing model, and start measuring pricing impact, KPIs, and other metrics related to commercial success.", "Episode 6.md-18": "OS: From your experience, what do businesses ask from pricing consultants, and what do they actually need when they hire consultants for their companies?", "Episode 6.md-19": "ZO: That's a great question. In my experience, businesses often need guidance and support to avoid making costly mistakes. They may require some mentoring, tweaking of their pricing methodologies, and best practice advice to optimize their pricing strategies. To use a burger joint as an example, if someone wants to open a burger shop but is not a chef, they would hire a consultant to set up the shop, provide recipes, tools, and teach their staff. Similarly, businesses hire consultants to assist them in setting up their pricing strategy and then move forward on their own. However, I believe a new generation of pricing consultants is emerging, and they answer a different question.", "Episode 6.md-20": "The new question is, \"What is the pricing solution that I should work with?\" For larger companies with budgets for pricing tools, they may not have the in-depth knowledge required to understand the different pricing solutions and which tool is best for their industry. This is where the new generation of pricing consultants comes in. They are experts in various pricing tools, and pricing solutions, and can match corporate needs with the right pricing strategy and infrastructure. Infrastructure and governance are significant challenges for large corporations, and pricing consultants with the appropriate expertise can help them overcome these challenges.", "Episode 6.md-21": "OS: That's a fascinating concept. The new generation of consultants matches the offer with the demand, as businesses may not know what they need, and there may not be any pricing experts within the company.", "Episode 6.md-22": "ZO: Exactly, no one is to blame. Startups and successful corporations do not have to be pricing experts. When a large corporation buys an expensive electrical piece of equipment, they do not choose something from a catalog. Instead, they go to an expert and ask for the best solution for their needs. Similarly, businesses should approach pricing and commercial strategy with the same mindset.\n\nOS: What advice would you give your younger self to start a career in pricing?", "Episode 6.md-23": "ZO: Initially, I found the pricing to be a bit too geeky and statistics-heavy, and I wondered whether it was science or art. Are you a statistician, a salesperson, or a cheap psychologist? However, as I delved deeper into pricing, I realized it was a combination of all these skills. Pricing is not just about formulas, but it involves understanding human behavior, psychology, and how people make buying decisions. I spent too many years in commercial before I realized that I was passionate about pricing, which gets you across almost the entire organization, from cost to revenue to profit. Pricing is not just a made-up profession, and I would advise my younger self to explore pricing with an open mind and embrace the challenge.", "Episode 6.md-24": "In conclusion, businesses hire pricing consultants to avoid making costly mistakes, receive guidance and support, and optimize their pricing strategies. The new generation of pricing consultants are experts in various pricing tools and solutions and can match corporate needs with the right pricing strategy and infrastructure. Pricing is not just about formulas, but it involves understanding human behavior, psychology, and how people make buying decisions. It is a challenging and rewarding profession that gets you across almost the entire organization, from cost to revenue to profit.", "Episode 6.md-25": "OS: Definitely. Thank you for this conversation. It was really insightful. I got so many new things to think about, even though I'm not a pricing manager. So I guess our listeners would be more than satisfied even more.\n\nThank you for being my guest today. \n\nZO: Thank you. It's been a pleasure and even though you let me talk way too much. I had an interesting conversation, so thank you!", "Episode 3.md-0": "Hello and welcome to the Pricing Heroes podcast by Competera. \n\nThis is a series of interviews with the best and class retail pricing experts driving their companies' bottom metrics and the retail industry as a whole. Today's guest is Juan Diaz Barrientos, pricing manager at one of the biggest home retailers in Sweden, Finland, and Norway and ex-implementation manager at IBM based in Stockholm. \n\nQ: Hi, Juan, and thank you for joining us. \n\nA: Hi, Olena. Thank you for inviting me.", "Episode 3.md-1": "Q: Hi, Juan, and thank you for joining us. \n\nA: Hi, Olena. Thank you for inviting me. \n\nQ: Can you tell our listeners more about yourself and your professional steps?", "Episode 3.md-2": "A: Sure. I'm originally from Colombia. I moved to Sweden around 15 years ago. I did it because of my Master's, and since then, I decided to stay in Sweden. And that's when my career in pricing started. \nI started working for the G4S in Colombia, doing cost-plus pricing. I come from pricing from the old days when the price wasn't a thing. So the position was more focused on pre-sales. We only did pricing ABC costing and then added some margin. After moving to Sweden, I started working as a pricing analyst at Coop. I was quickly promoted to a senior position within Coop, where I continued developing pricing strategies. At that time, we adopted our pricing tool, DemandTec, from IBM. So we were in the whole implementation team.", "Episode 3.md-3": "Then I moved to a company called Rexel. I worked as a business analyst there and helped them to create an analytical department. They didn't have any department to handle analysis, so the position was very broad. IBM was my previous vendor, so they knew me very well and wanted me to join.", "Episode 3.md-4": "At IBM, I handled four of the biggest food retailers in the Nordics. I was at IBM for about 3 years, and then I decided to take on the challenge of joining the current company I'm working for today, where we handle home improvement retailing with a new department created from scratch.\nWhen I first joined, putting together the pricing team, we could increase prices by 20 million Swedish crowns per month, with every team member working full-time in all the countries of operation on price increases. \nNow we can take 500 million, probably because we were pushed a lot by inflation. Also because we have improved processes and competencies in the team. That's a little bit about me. \nI'm an economist. That's my background. I also have a Bachelor's in business administration, and I have two Master's, one in risk management and the other one in finance.", "Episode 3.md-5": "Q: And now, with rising inflation, risk management sounds really up-to-date. \nAnd you mentioned that you were the first to implement the pricing tools back in 2012.", "Episode 3.md-6": "A: That's when Coop bought DemandTec. It was one of the most advanced tools in the market. There were fewer competitors than there are today. So the offer for pricing tools has grown a lot.\nThese tools have really nice features, but their implementations are always challenging. Most of the problems usually happen with data integration in any implementation. Companies tend to believe they have all the data available and that it's easy to transfer. \nBut that's not usually the case. So there was a lot of data cleansing, and we had to go through many fixes, tweaks, and tricks to make the system work correctly. \nToday, Coop has much better data. I was their consultant after I left the company, and I had seen an improvement in data. But one of the most painful parts is always the data integration side.", "Episode 3.md-7": "Q: Definitely. And that is the key to success in implementation. And you said you developed the pricing department from scratch in your current position. So what are your and your team's major wins throughout 2022?", "Episode 3.md-8": "A: It's been really hard for everybody, I guess. But I'm very proud of a lot of the things we have accomplished during 2022. And the main success was handling 9.5% inflation, which we haven't really had for a while. As I mentioned before, it has been a huge challenge for a team, as the company wasn't really able to take out those amounts of money in price increases. So that's one of the biggest milestones. It was super painful at the beginning. I cannot guarantee we did all the price increases right, but we did what we had to do, and now we have a smooth process in place. The most difficult part was at the beginning. Now that the process is in place and we know what to do, it has become much easier to handle. \nBut for the department itself, starting from scratch, I would say one of the main success factors in 2022 was to establish a team with the right competence and the right roles inside the classroom. \nSo when I joined the team, I inherited analysts who were not pricing experts. I needed to educate them from zero as well. And we had all the team members located in Sweden. We didn't have any local competence for Norway and Finland. They are the Nordics, but we are totally different countries. You cannot assume that the table lamp you sell in Sweden and the Swedish usually put beside the windows is going to sell in Finland when they don't even understand where to put the table lamp. \nThose kinds of things are really important for local knowledge. So we established a team of six different analysts with different profiles. Two focus on the Norwegian market, two focus on the Swedish market, and two with focus on the Finnish market. \nAnd we divided the team into three different roles. One senior pricing analyst became a pricing strategist and monitoring analyst. Then we also created pricing executors and pricing coordinators roles. \nAnd the role division also helped us to reach the targets throughout the year. We also made it to automate a lot of different processes, like data scraping or competitive data analytics. \nWe are a retailer, so we have a lot of competitors that sell exactly the same product. We needed to be smart, identify the competitors to follow, and develop a model that today is fully automatic. \nWe got some help from the AI team. We built everything in Excel first, and we started working with Excel templates. But as you know, Excel is way out of capacity when it comes to pricing today. So the only choice is process automation. And it has been a huge win for the team with free time for the analysts to do real analytical jobs instead of having analysts doing very administrative things like manual templates and analysis.\nNevertheless, even though we had quite a hard time handling the inflation, we started rolling out our main pricing strategy: building the price perception.", "Episode 3.md-9": "Q: So, how many people are in your pricing department now? \n\nA: With me, we are seven.", "Episode 3.md-10": "Q: And you manage the prices for all three countries: Sweden, Finland, and Norway. That sounds impressive because, as far as I understand, you have more than 180 stores in three of these countries. \nYour and your team's coping strategy is impressive, especially during inflation. Speaking of which: the holiday season is coming. So what are your thoughts on the current state of home retail in conjunction with the upcoming holiday season and surging inflation? Do you see any new patterns from your customers? Or maybe everything remains the same, and we just make too much fuss.", "Episode 3.md-11": "A: There are two main patterns. One of them has been really well known in the past and in times of recession. People tend to move towards private labels. \nSo we see a big switch in terms of volumes between the known brands and the private labels. That's a big win, especially because we usually get better gross margins from the private label. Otherwise, they wouldn't even exist.", "Episode 3.md-12": "And one of the biggest wins is that the people that pick the private label usually stick to the private label. So it's a stable switch in volumes, very positive for private labels, and very positive for companies to develop the right private labels and start selling them as you might get some loyal customers.", "Episode 3.md-13": "And the second one, not surprisingly, is not only because of inflation but mostly because of energy prices. There is a boom for smart home products to help you to understand your energy consumption better.", "Episode 3.md-14": "I have heard cases of some of our customers or even employees that have made it to reduce their energy consumption by 30% by making their homes much smarter. This last applies much better when you have an old house. \nThere are a lot of old houses in the Nordics, so we see a pattern there, sadly. We don't really own the smart home sector, but we are present, and we see there is a big increase and a big interest from our clients. \nI guess this will be the longstanding trend probably because the energy prices just became like a little push, which will keep this ball rolling, I guess, for a couple of decades for sure.", "Episode 3.md-15": "Q: Speaking about the private labels. I interviewed Paul Peugnet from Carrefour, France, and he shared the same thing about private labels. Consumers are switching to them, and the pricing teams see a very positive trend for domestic sellers and private labels. \nAnd you confirm that this is a longstanding and positive trend as well. And speaking about your profound experience at IBM. \nHow do you think companies should employ pricing technologies to stay afloat and thrive during the current recession?", "Episode 3.md-16": "A: In times of recession, in terms of inflation, it is highly important to have the right system besides you. It is very easy to make price increases by 300 million in total when the volumes are stable. \nBut what happens when the volumes are not static? \nSo 300 million can easily become only 150 million, and then you haven't really done enough to handle inflation. That's when these systems come into the game. They help you to understand where to make the price changes that really matter.", "Episode 3.md-17": "It's impossible to think that any person or company in the world can handle 10,000 SKUs without tech. For example, it's impossible that a big food retailer with 200,000 SKUs, Excel, and one person will implement price changes and then wait 2 weeks to see what happens.", "Episode 3.md-18": "I mean, it's ridiculous to think that it is going to bring any kind of positive results when the amount of SKUs is huge. So these systems usually help you to calculate the elasticity and cross-elasticity for every single product and understand if there are any complementary or substitute goods. They help to create better strategies and identify where you really can affect the gross margin and volumes positively with your price changes.", "Episode 3.md-19": "I see a very important trend when it comes to understanding the underlying factors of price changes, more retailers are relying on technology. Understanding raw materials, transportation costs, and all those variables together is just too much information for a human to handle. So these systems help you to analyze that information and to make better decisions by understanding the underlying factors of the price increases.", "Episode 3.md-20": "And this also helps you to go and renegotiate with your suppliers. If the vendor is increasing the price, you can help them understand if this price is a good base for a price increase that customers will understand. Customers are not stupid. So if you just increase the price by 10% that doesn't have any special raw material where prices have increased, or any transportation cost because it's a local product or whatever the reason is, customers probably are not going to like it.", "Episode 3.md-21": "If you understand the underlying factor, then customers are also going to be more willing to pay the extra price increase because they understand the root of the cost. In addition, it's important to know that most of these systems also have a model that is called deal management, and it's a model designed to work together with vendors.", "Episode 3.md-22": "In times of inflation, I don't believe retailers should be working alone. It should be pretty much a partnership with your vendor so you can decide what is best for the future of both companies together.\n\nAnd I also want to add about companies' maturity. There is huge opposition in companies where the culture is not mature enough, so it's wise to postpone the implementation of tech pricing solutions for later to make the transformation smoother for the company.", "Episode 3.md-23": "From my experience at IBM, immaturity is one of the major issues in every implementation process. This is why change management is highly important. People don't understand people. Usually, if you are not reporting prices to other analysts, you're probably reporting prices to purchase, and people in purchasing don't have all that data. They only make a forecast out of an initial price. There is nothing wrong with that. But as soon as you come up with a new price and say, \"it's because of elasticity here, it's because this other product changed here,\" then you come up with 20 different reasons why you change the price for a product.", "Episode 3.md-24": "If they are not mature enough to digest all the new data that is coming, their first option will be to oppose the recommended prices.", "Episode 3.md-25": "Q: Definitely, yes. And the level of maturity really matters. \nThe same thing. I interviewed one of the pricing experts Dr. Markus Husemann-Kopetzky from Munich, Germany, and he also touched upon this particular problem. He mentioned that to be a successful pricing manager, you have to be an excellent orator. So you must speak a lot and know how to convey your thoughts and arguments. \n\nA: I totally agree.", "Episode 3.md-26": "A: I totally agree. \n\nQ: And coming from reality and into the future. How do you imagine the future of pricing? What are your thoughts about the pricing for ten years ahead?", "Episode 3.md-27": "A: What I see in retailing in the Nordics is that there is still a big division between the campaign departments and the base pricing or regular pricing departments. \nSo we are pretty much fighting with each other. But the truth is that the main goal of any department is to improve gross margins. \nThere are two different approaches, but both, at the end of the day, have a lot to do with pricing. And to drive the company's pricing strategy, you need to put campaign and regular pricing teams together. Putting them together will give the capacity to stop thinking only about the price and probably transform the pricing arena into more margin optimization analysis instead of thinking only about the final price. And I definitely see more and more senior management realizing these new pricing capabilities. \nI also feel like people are more aware of not developing their own pricing solutions. I'm against developing pricing solutions just because they rely too much on the knowledge of one or two people in the organization. It's true that they can be much more tailor-made, but they don't get upgraded as far as established companies. So I think more companies realize that those investments, at the end of the day, can be much more expensive than buying an established pricing solution.", "Episode 3.md-28": "Q: And one of the last questions: what literature, media, and podcasts about pricing and retail do you read and listen to? What inspires you?\nOne of my favorite podcasts is called \"Talk fast, Think smart\". It doesn't have to do anything with pricing. It's just about the power of communication and how to communicate better. And as the doctor you have interviewed previously told you, a lot is about communication, sending the message, explaining, making your ideas clear, and making everybody understand you.", "Episode 3.md-29": "I also like the McKinsey podcast on consumer retailing. That's a really good podcast, especially because they usually invite one person from every region. So it's not only very focused on America. But also focuses on Europe and Asia, and you get to hear the different trends in the different markets and the different difficulties. \nIt's usually unreachable, and their guests usually come up with newly released research.", "Episode 3.md-30": "Then when it comes to literature. More specifically, if you are going through a pricing transformation, I would really highly recommend World Class Pricing: The Journey Book by Jim Saunders and Paul Hunt.", "Episode 3.md-31": "For those trying to adopt some data-driven approach around pricing, forget a little bit about the gut feeling. Try McKinsey. BCG Group. They have a lot of free articles, and you just go to their website and then download those articles, like price perception or KVIs. Just to have the overview, I think a five-page article could be enough to have an idea and to have a path to follow.", "Episode 3.md-32": "Also, academics in pricing are very important. I would really suggest that you go back to your academics. At the end of the day, what you are trying to do with pricing is to maximize gross margin. And for that, you need to maximize the demand curve. That's what you are trying to do. So it becomes very academic. And how do you maximize the demand curve? Well, there are a bunch of academics around it. The microeconomics around pricing is really important. It gives you a good understanding and overview.", "Episode 3.md-33": "Q: And what advice would you give to your younger self starting a career in pricing?", "Episode 3.md-34": "Data literacy is also very important. Not only Excel. Excel is good, but you'd better move towards more sophisticated data-driven systems. Python could be one of them. \nLearn to code a little bit. We don't have to become data scientists, but we need to be able to retrieve our own information, and we need to be able to understand the information. And sometimes, understanding consumer patterns can take you to analyze 80 million invoices, and you cannot do that with Excel. \nSo Python becomes much more sophisticated too. So I would suggest starting with the basics. Try to make yourself more familiar with and try to learn a little bit about data visualization. That's also really important.", "Episode 3.md-35": "Q: Juan, thank you so much for this interview. It is really insightful, and I hope our audience and our listeners will enjoy it as much as I did. Thank you for joining me today. \n\nA: Thank you very much for your time. Lena, keep in touch. Thanks."}
