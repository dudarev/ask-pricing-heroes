It is recommended to take an analytical and granular approach, considering factors such as the size of price increases, demand elasticity, inventory situation, supply stability, competitor actions, and pricing power. A targeted pricing response based on the specific situation is recommended, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.\n",
