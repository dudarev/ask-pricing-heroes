Rising procurement costs and price-conscious customers can also put pressure on margins, both from below and above (Episode 1.md-13). Additionally, during times of recession and inflation, customers tend to become more price conscious, avoid excessive debt, and postpone purchases of durable goods and holidays (Episode 3.md-16, Episode 1.md-12).\n",

It is recommended to take an analytical and granular approach, considering factors such as the size of price increases, demand elasticity, inventory situation, supply stability, competitor actions, and pricing power. A targeted pricing response based on the specific situation is recommended, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.\n",
